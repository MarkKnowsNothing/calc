# Markulator - not-so-original calculator you'll ever use

Quite a project, took me 2 weeks to finish it.

Features:
- Basic calculations
- Clear and all clear button
- Dot button for decimals

Things to add in the future:
- Keyboard support
- Better display in power function
- That one message you get from dividing a number by 0 (somehow the computer returns 0 ðŸ’€)
